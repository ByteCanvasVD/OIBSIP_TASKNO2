 <h3> 2. BMI Calculator</h3>
 <b>Project Overview: </b>
 <p>Project Overview: Tkinter was used to create the graphical BMI Calculator application in Python. Users can enter their height and weight, and it will compute their BMI (body mass index) and classify them into pre-established health groups. Other capabilities include the ability to store user data, view historical data, and use statistics and graphs to analyze BMI patterns.</p>
<h3>Implementation Details: </h3>
<p><h4>itialization:</h4> The BMI Calculator class is created at the beginning of the program.<br>
Button, entry widget, and label initialization are included in the Tkinter GUI.<br>
<h4>User Communication:</h4>
Users fill in the available entry fields with their height and weight.<br>
The BMI calculation process is initiated by clicking the "Calculate BMI" button.<br>
<h4>]Calculating BMI:</h4>
The application computes the BMI and verifies the user's input.<br>
A popup window displaying the result and the BMI along with its health category is displayed.<br>
<h4>Information Storage:<h4></h4>
The SQLite database stores user data such as height, weight, BMI, category, and date.<br>
<h4>Seeing Historical Events:</h4>
A table with historical BMI data is displayed in a new window that appears when you click the "View History" button.<br>
<h4>Analysis of BMI Trends:</h4>
A bar chart displaying the BMI trend over time is produced when you click the "Show BMI Trend" button in the history window.</p><br>
<h3>Format of Output:</h3><p> BMI Result Popup:<br>
A popup box displaying the estimated BMI and its health category appears when the user does a BMI calculation.<br>
BMI Historical View:<br>
A table containing timestamps, weight, height, BMI, and category is displayed in the history pane.<br>
Window for BMI Trend Analysis:<br>
The BMI trends over time are displayed as a bar chart in the trend analysis box.</p>
<h3> conclusion:</h3> <p>this BMI Calculator project offers customers a complete tool for monitoring and assessing their BMI by combining GUI components, data storage, and visualization. User-friendly interaction is ensured by the Tkinter interface, and data storage is made easier by the SQLite database. This project serves as an example of how Python may be used for interactive application development as well as scientific calculations.</p>
